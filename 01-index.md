# RuralKG Dataset

RuralKG is a hierarchical data repository and knowledgebase generated from multiple federal sources (e.g., NSDUH, NIBRS, TEDS-A/D). It focuses on improving our understanding of risk environments (e.g., substance abuse, mental health, and social justice) in rural regions of the United States and strengthening rural resilience. It provides a complete data processing pipeline—from raw data extraction to the deployment of a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system—making it a robust resource for researchers, practitioners, and educators.

## Project Overview

Instead of a single dataset, RuralKG is dedicated to providing reliable and reusable datasets and knowledge graphs for all the components of the RuralKG pipeline. Datasets from different layers represent different aspects of the readiness of the knowledge representation.

1. **Extended CSV Generation:**  
   Raw data from federal codebooks (e.g., NSDUH) is processed into an extended CSV format, capturing rich, structured information. This approach utilizes the structure of the codebooks that the most vital variable section in the codebook is organized in a table-like pattern.

   The scripts and methods for the extended CSV generation are available at [02-pdf-parsing](02-pdf-parsing.md).

   One generated extended CSV file for NSDUH 2022 codebook is available at [ndsuh_2022_codebook.csv](data/nsduh_2022_codebook.csv).

2. **Ontology & Knowledge Graph Construction:**  
   The CSV data is used to build an ontology and a comprehensive knowledge graph that interconnects disparate data sources.

3. **Database Integration:**  
   Leveraging the knowledge graph, a relational database is constructed to manage both intermediate and final data effectively.

4. **RAG System Deployment:**  
   All the processed materials support a retrieval-augmented generation system, facilitating intelligent query responses and data exploration for both academic research and public service applications.

## Alpha Version Demo

An alpha version of the RuralKG Web Service is available at [RuralKG Web Service](http://52.170.155.134:8050/).

In this demo, you can explore:
- **Knowledge Queries:** Retrieve background information and insights about the dataset components.
- **Data Queries:** Access detailed data on substances and related metrics.
- **Service Queries:** Find mental health treatment facilities and other public service providers in rural areas.

Test cases and further documentation are available at [RuralKG Test Cases](data/test_case.csv).
